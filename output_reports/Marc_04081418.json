    "prompt2_firstimpr": "Piet initially appeared nervous but quickly showed a friendly vibe with a smile and easy connection. He communicates smoothly, although his enthusiasm can sometimes seem slightly over the top during the initial interaction.",
    "prompt3_personality": "Piet comes across as a mature individual with a realistic self-image, bringing experience from an active student life and various jobs. He expressed a clear motivation for a traineeship focusing on data and personal development, seeing it as an ideal environment to start his career. Piet shows a strong eagerness to learn and develop himself, which was evident during the PAPI interview where he reflected openly on feedback. He actively seeks opportunities to grow, isn't afraid of challenges, and demonstrated during the role-play exercises that he can quickly adapt his approach based on constructive input. His high score on conceptual orientation in the PAPI aligns with this curiosity and drive to understand things more deeply. <<BREAK>>\u2022 He connects easily with others in an open, spontaneous, and friendly manner, making a positive impression during interactions like the Curious Case group activity. This aligns with his PAPI results suggesting a high need for personal relationships and comfort in social settings (high O and Q scores). He generally contributes to a positive group atmosphere. <<BREAK>>\u2022 Piet is result-oriented and works hard towards his goals, taking ownership and showing persistence, as mentioned in the assessment notes. He is proactive, like when he initiated activities during Covid in a previous role, and tries to bring structure to tasks, for example by suggesting a shared document during the Curious Case. This drive is supported by his high PAPI score for need to achieve (A). <<BREAK>>\u2022 This strong focus on results is a great asset for getting things done. At times, like during the first role-play, this drive could come across as a bit hurried or overly focused on his own solution, potentially leaving less space for exploring the other person's perspective fully. His PAPI profile indicates a lower preference for influencing others (low P), suggesting this directness might emerge more under pressure. However, his significant improvement in the second role-play highlights his ability to adjust and adopt a more listening, empathetic stance when aware of it. <<BREAK>>\u2022 He possesses a creative mindset, often thinking 'out of the box' to find solutions, a quality he recognizes in himself and was observed during the Business Case. This is consistent with his PAPI results showing a preference for innovation (high R) and flexibility with rules (low W), allowing him to approach problems from fresh angles. <<BREAK>>\u2022 Piet demonstrates good self-awareness, as seen in the PAPI interview where he could realistically discuss his strengths and areas for improvement. An area to keep developing is consistently maintaining awareness of group dynamics; sometimes, as noted in the assessment feedback and during the Curious Case, he might get focused and forget to explicitly check in or solicit opinions from others. This might relate to his very low need for recognition indicated in the PAPI (low X), perhaps making him less naturally focused on drawing attention to or from the group. His openness means he is well-positioned to enhance this aspect. <<BREAK>>\u2022 Overall, Piet presents as a positive and optimistic person, which can be inspiring for those around him, aligning with his high PAPI score for positivity (J). He shows adaptability and resilience, taking feedback onboard and demonstrating growth even within the assessment day itself. <<BREAK>>Piet's strong motivation, eagerness to learn, positive connecting style, and result-driven nature make him a valuable addition. His self-awareness and openness to feedback provide a solid foundation for his development journey during the traineeship. We hired Piet because we see great potential in his drive combined with his capacity for reflection and growth.",
