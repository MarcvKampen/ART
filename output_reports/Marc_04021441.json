    "prompt2_firstimpr": "Piet appears natural, open, and spontaneous, often smiling and making good eye contact. However, initial nervousness was observed, and he tends to speak quickly, sometimes impacting clarity, especially in Dutch.",
    "prompt3_personality": "Piet shows a clear motivation for a data traineeship, seeing it as an ideal way to develop his passion for data and start his career. He comes from an academic background and currently works part-time, bringing a desire to explore the business world. Piet possesses a strong intrinsic drive for personal development and learning, particularly evident in his passion for data where he actively seeks ways to learn and fill knowledge gaps identified during the assessment. This eagerness to learn and improve is a significant asset for the traineeship. <<BREAK>>\u2022 He demonstrates good receptiveness to feedback and the ability to adapt his behavior accordingly, as clearly shown by the marked improvement between his first and second role-play exercises where he shifted from pushing his own solution to active listening and exploring the other person's needs. <<BREAK>>\u2022 Piet has a reasonable level of self-awareness and is open to discussing his personality traits, as observed during the PAPI discussion. However, his self-reflection could benefit from more depth, sometimes focusing more on the process he followed rather than fully exploring the impact of his actions or alternative approaches, which was noticeable after the initial role-play. <<BREAK>>\u2022 He is strongly result-driven and works hard towards achieving goals, demonstrating ownership by taking initiative, such as organizing events or proactively learning Python. This focus is generally positive but can become a pitfall, occasionally leading him to push forward without sufficiently involving others or considering their perspectives first, as seen initially in the role-play. <<BREAK>>\u2022 Piet generally connects easily with others in an informal, spontaneous, and positive manner, contributing to a good atmosphere in group settings like the Twinkletown game. This aligns with his PAPI profile suggesting comfort in building relationships (high O score). <<BREAK>>\u2022 While aiming to collaborate, he sometimes initiates actions, like creating a shared document during the game, without explicitly checking for group consensus first. This tendency might relate to his high confidence in leadership (PAPI L score) combined with a lower innate need to direct others (PAPI P score), leading him to take initiative somewhat independently. <<BREAK>>\u2022 He tends to state his opinion but avoids pushing it strongly, preferring harmony, which aligns with a moderate PAPI score on assertiveness (K). A point of attention is that he can sometimes get absorbed in his own thoughts and may need prompting to actively solicit input from others around him. <<BREAK>>\u2022 His communication can sometimes be hindered by speaking quickly, particularly when nervous or communicating in English, which was noted during his presentation. Focusing on pace and clarity will be beneficial. <<BREAK>>\u2022 Piet sees himself as creative and enjoys thinking 'out of the box' to find solutions, a trait confirmed during the assessment and supported by his PAPI profile (high R score). <<BREAK>>\u2022 He shows a preference for a spontaneous, reactive approach over detailed forward planning, preferring to handle issues as they arise (low PAPI H score). While adaptable, developing more structured planning habits will be important for managing larger projects effectively. <<BREAK>>\u2022 Consistent with his PAPI profile (low I score), Piet tends towards a more cautious and considered decision-making style, weighing options carefully. This thoroughness is valuable but might slow him down in situations requiring rapid choices. <<BREAK>>\u2022 He naturally prefers to operate more in the background rather than seeking the spotlight (very low PAPI X score), contributing when he feels he adds specific value. While this supports teamwork, developing comfort with a greater presence could enhance his impact. <<BREAK>>Piet presents as a highly motivated and eager learner with a genuine passion for data and considerable potential. His key strengths lie in his drive, adaptability, and positive interpersonal approach. Development opportunities centre on balancing his strong result-focus with increased sensitivity to group dynamics, enhancing communication clarity, and cultivating more proactive planning skills.",
