    "prompt2_firstimpr": "Piet presents as open, natural, and smiling, connecting smoothly with good eye contact. Initial nervousness can lead to very fast speech, creating a sometimes rushed or slightly over-the-top vibe.",
    "prompt3_personality": "Piet presents as a motivated individual, keen on pursuing a data-focused traineeship to develop his skills further and gain experience across different business environments. Piet shows a strong intrinsic motivation and eagerness to learn, particularly in the data field where he demonstrates genuine passion. This drive is evident in his proactive self-learning efforts, like taking Python courses and using tools like ChatGPT to accelerate his progress, and his willingness to tackle challenges head-on, as seen during the Ormitella case preparation. <<BREAK>>\u2022 He possesses good self-awareness and is notably open to feedback, reflecting maturely on his performance and experiences. This was particularly clear in the role-play exercise where he significantly adjusted his approach after receiving feedback, demonstrating coachability and a genuine desire for personal development. <<BREAK>>\u2022 Interpersonally, Piet generally comes across as open, spontaneous, and positive, connecting easily with others in informal settings like the Curious Case. He values teamwork and contributes to a positive group atmosphere, although his enthusiasm and focus might occasionally lead him to take up significant space. <<BREAK>>\u2022 He demonstrates creativity and enjoys thinking 'out of the box' to find solutions, seeing data challenges as engaging puzzles. This innovative drive was noted during the Ormitella case and supported by his self-description during the PAPI discussion. <<BREAK>>\u2022 Piet has high confidence in his leadership abilities, reflected in the PAPI, and isn't afraid to take initiative, such as suggesting structure during the Curious Case or leading initiatives during his studies. He is persistent and works hard to achieve the goals he sets for himself. <<BREAK>>\u2022 A key development area is balancing his strong results orientation with interpersonal sensitivity and process awareness. In the first role-play and parts of the Curious Case, he appeared focused on driving towards a solution, sometimes potentially overlooking emotional cues or the need for group consensus before acting. <<BREAK>>\u2022 While adaptable, Piet shows a preference for spontaneity over structured planning, as indicated in the PAPI results and observed in his approach. This might require attention in roles demanding significant foresight and detailed project management, ensuring thoroughness isn't sacrificed for speed or flexibility. <<BREAK>>\u2022 His communication can be impacted by nerves, particularly in higher-stress situations or when speaking English, leading him to speak quickly. While generally open and direct, he should be mindful of ensuring his communication remains considerate, especially given his tendency towards transparency with emotions (low E score on PAPI) combined with resilience (higher Y score on PAPI). <<BREAK>>\u2022 Finding a consistent and effective influencing style is another growth point. His low preference for directing others (PAPI) sometimes contrasts with his confidence and drive, requiring conscious effort to involve others consistently and seek input proactively, avoiding the 'bubble' mentioned in feedback. <<BREAK>>In summary, Piet is a highly motivated, open, and creative individual with a strong passion for learning and data. His key development journey will involve refining his interpersonal approach to better balance results with collaboration, enhancing planning skills, and ensuring consistently impactful communication.",
